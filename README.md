The reason for creating the project is that saw a question that someone asked how to do scraping for this website in "**Python Taiwan Community**" of Facebook group, and in the processing of answering, I think that need to write program by myself, and then will know what the detail, even though there are some tips how to crack.

The project was completed in **2019.06.28**, and the website will change to other anti-scraping method by the time, so the program will crashed in the future. If you discover the problem, free feel to send a PR or Issue thanks!
